<p><span lang="cy">LLwybr LLaethog</span> v <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> - &quot;LLanrwst&quot;</p>

<p>Hipdub reggaehoppers LL-LL are probably John Peel's 2nd favourite Welsh language act post Gorky's. <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> were the 80s rebel rockers whose lead singer, Mark Roberts, went on to form Catatonia. Here the former give the latter's anthem <span lang="cy">Cymru Lloegr a Llanrwst</span> an ADF-style punk/dub makeover. The result is fast, furious and funky, with samples of someone who sounds suspiciously like SFA's Gruff Rhys. Not that the Welsh music scene is incestuous or anything.</p>
