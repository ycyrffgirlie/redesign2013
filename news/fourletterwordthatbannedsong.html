<h1>Four-letter word that banned song</h1>

<h3>By Deiniol Tegid</h3>

<p>A punk band have had one of their songs banned from Welsh-language Radio Cymru because it contains a four-letter word.</p>

<p>The tape, featuring Conwy Valley rock band <span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> was broadcast on the air on Saturday morning. </p>

<p><font size="5"><b>Inquiry</b></font></p>

<p>And singer Marc Roberts, who works in the family business as a butcher in LLanrwst, blames the BBC for the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>&quot;The concert was recorded a year ago and has played on Radio Cymru once before.&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the BBC's own fault. They should have listened to the tape before broadcasting it.&quot;</p>

<p><span lang="cy">Y Cyrff</span> - voted Wales' top rock band in an HTV opinion poll - used the word during a concert in Aberystwyth a year ago which featured serveral punk and alternative groups.</p>

<p>An immediate inquiry was launched after the programme, which resulted in the head of Radio Cymru, Mr Meirion Edwards, ordering the offencing tape to be destroyed.</p>

<p>BBC Press officer Mr Gwyn Griffiths said: &quot;The tape had been played before but no-one had noticed the offending word then. But the tape certainly should not have been broadcast.&quot;</p>
