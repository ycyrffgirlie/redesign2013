<h1>Y Cyrff</h1>
<p>Y Cyrff (The Bodies) was formed at Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy (LLanrwst School) in 1983. An early line-up included Emyr Davies on vocals, Dylan 
Hughes on drums, Mark Roberts on guitar and Barry Cawley on bass. </p>
<p>
Early on, Mark, Dylan and Barry confessed their love of The Clash and the songs they composed, even when sung in Welsh, had a distinctive 
&quot;Clash&quot; sound.(Listen to the drumbeat at the start of Tic Toc, then listen to the drumbeat at the start of Capital Radio One by 
The Clash, and you will see what I mean). </p>
<p>Y Cyrff played their first gig at LLansannan supporting Y Peth\'ma (These Things Here) and after a couple of gigs, The early line-up didn\'t last, 
Emyr move away from the LLanrwst area, which enable Mark to take up on vocals as the guitar. The band continued to rehearse their future set. 
Barry and Mark had asked Paul Jones to come to rehearsal. He took over playing bass from Barry.</p>
<p>At Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy, it was their Geography teacher, Toni Schiavone who encouraged them to sing in Welsh. Later Toni was to take 
responsibility for booking their gigs with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith Cymreig (Welsh Language Society) and their first gig. </p>
<p>Y Cyrff gigged across North Wales. It was at one of these gigs in 1984 that they met Rhys Mwyn (bassist from Yr Anhrefn) who invited them to 
record two tracks for the compilation "Cam O\'r Tywyllwch" (released on Rhys\' record label \'Recordiau Anhrefn\'). Y Cyrff had recorded \'Tic Toc\' and 
\'Lebanon\' for it. It was not long before Y Cyrff released two more singles - Pum Munud and Yr Haint. By this stage the band were regularly appear 
on the television station S4C. The band badly wanted the explosure, even managed a slot on 
\'Stid\'. It was not until 1985/6 that the Welsh media started to sit up and take notice of 
Y Cyrff.</p>

<div class="quotes">
	&quot;Wales, England and LLanrwst and Y Cyrff! The thing about Y Cyrff is their 
	being after respresenting speacially Conwy Valley and Llanrwst, some type of 
	pride and independence is typically of the place and people. Y Cyrff was 
	representing 80\'s Wales - series of gigs "LLanrwst yn LLosgi" (LLanrwst\'s 
	burning) and all the new groups played there. Music is best ever conveying idea 
	of time and feeling of the place. Hear Y Cyrff played in front of their people, 
	themselves was hearing the best - in any language. More that, on stage, Y Cyrff 
	was one of the little groups who was forcing your observation. Performances 
	uncomprise and shaking - Sunday night Eisteddfod LLanrwst or Saturday Night 
	Cwn Rhymni and tens of evenings, being the songs stands with the best that live 
	rock produced. The group was giving music and the performances on stage that 
	other grown live rock, there\'s a message to every other band. And was with 
	something to say.&quot; - Toni

<p>Thank you Tony.</p>

	&quot;Cymru, LLoegr a Llanrwst - a\'r Y Cyrff! Y peth am Y Cyrff yw eu bod wedi 
	cyrychioli yr hyn sydd yn arbennig am DDyffryn Conwy a LLanrst- rhyw fath o 
	falchder ac annibyniaeth sydd yn nodweddiadol o\'r lle a\'r bobl. Roedd Y Cyrff yn 
	cynrychoili Cymru\'r wythdegau - Cyfres gigs "LLanrwst yn LLosgi" a\'r holl 
	grwpiau newydd a fu\'n chwarae yno. Mae\'r gerddoriaeth gorau erioed yn cyfleu 
	syniad o amser ac ymdeimlad o le. Clywed Y Cyrff yn chwarae o flean eu pobl eu
	hunain oedd clywed y gorau - mewn unrhyw iaith. Mwy na hynny, ar y llwyfan, Y
	Cyrff oedd un o\'r ychydig grwpiau oedd yn gorfodi eich sylw - perfformiadau 
	hollol digyfawaddawd ac ysgytwol- nos Sul \'Steddfod LLanrwst neu nos Sadwrn 
	Cwn Rhymni ac degau o nosweithia cyffelyb. Bydd swn Y Cyrff yn parhau i gyffroi,
	bydd y caneuon yn sefydd gyda\'r gorau y mae\'r byd roc wedi eu cynhyrchu. Y grwp 
	a oedd yn rhoi\'r gerddoriaeth a\'r perfformiadau ar y lyfan uwchben trifia\'r byd 
	roc, dyna\'r neges i bod grwp arall. Ac roedd ganddynt rhywbeth i\'w ddwend.&quot;

<p>Diolch Tony.</p>');
define("PAGE_TWO_TEXT", " <p>After appearing on T.V and the radio was starting to take 
notice of the band, Y Cyrff were staring to gig over Wales. In 1986, the band played at National 
Eisteddfod in RHyl. </p>

<p>On the release front, Toni put out a few copies of Dan Y Cownter on cassette which 
included studio and live tracks. The cassette sold out in a short time. </p>

<p>In 1987, Sain released Y Testament Newydd. The band also appeared on The Grey Whistle 
Test and The Tube.</p>

<p>In 1988, Dylan left to join Yr Anhrefin. Mark Kendall replaced him. The band tourned 
Poland. The Alarm had a habit of having a Welsh band supporting them and in November, 
it was Y Cyrff's time to be the support act. They played Colwyn Bay to 1500 people. </p>

<p>Another Eisteddfod  followed in the next year. This time the Eisteddfod was in LLanrwst. 
A homecoming gig for the band! In the same year Yr Atgyfodi was released on vinyl on Probe 
Plus. People at Rrobe Plus forget to put the title on. It contains the anthemn, Cymru, LLoegr a 
LLanrwst. Anobaith o Awdl followed on the Ankst label. It contain live tracks 
from Warsaw and Cardiff. Ankst was helping the band to get noticed outside of Wales. </p>

<p>LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd was released on Ankst in 1991. LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd had 
artwork by M.R. Swire and released on tape and vinyl. The inlay included the lyrics to Cwrdd, 
Eithaf and Nunlle. LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd was critically acclaimed. </p>

<p>The band released Mae DDoe Yn DDoe in 1992. The album was released on tape and C.D. 
It is 22 track album which has songs as early as as Trwy'r Cymylau (1986) to Mewn Plu (1992). 
Damwain Mewn FFatri Cyllell a FFyrc was a free tape with Mae DDoe Yn DDoe. Damwain Mewn
FFatri Cyllell a FFyrc included Lebanon and Tic Toc from Cam O'r Tywyllwch, it also has songs 
that appeared on T.V like Fy Enaid Noeth (Stid) and Hunanladdiad from Roc Rol Te, live BBC 
sessions (Mewn Plu and Eithaf) and other live live version of songs (LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd 
and Pethau Achlysurol).</p>

<p>After the release of Mae DDoe Yn DDoe, Y Cyrff split up.</p>

<p>LLwybr LLaethog did a re-mix of Y Cyrff's anthem, Cymru, LLoegr a LLanrwst, in 2000 in 
memory of Barry C. The re-mix is called LLanrwst which feature a sample. taken from the 
radio, of Mark Roberts taking about the writing of My Selfish Gene. </p>

<p>Sherbet Antlers (Mark Roberts and Paul's music project with John Griffiths and Kevs Ford 
of LLwybr LLaethog) did a \"cover\" of LLawenydd Heb DDiwed at a few of their gigs in 2004. 
Since then a few artist (such as Elin FFlur, Alan Tan Lan, Cor y Cyrff) have done live or studio 
covers of Y Cyrff tracks. </p>

<p>Y Cyrff's history doesn't end here because Rasal (part of Sain) released the box set 
Atalnod LLawn ion 2005. The box set had four C.Ds. C.D one had songs from Y Testament 
Newydd on it, C.D two had songs from Yr Atgyfodi on it. C.D three had tracks from 
LLawenydd Heb DDiwedd. C.D four contain the singles Pum Munud, Hwyl Fawr Heukwen / 
Pethau Achylysurol, Yr Haint and live tracks. </p>

<p>There was also a tour promoting the box set was called Cymru, LLoegr a LLanrwst with 
gigs in London, Cardiff and LLanrwst. Y Cyrff didn't reform but  young Welsh artists 
(Kentucky AFC, Alan Tan Lan, Maharashi, Dan Amor and Jen Jeniro) perform the gigs. </p>

<p>So is this the final chapel of Y Cyrff's history? The band who are remembered by their 
fans and press alike for their crafted songs, their passion and their talents and mysteries. 
The band who gave us the anthem, Cymru, LLoegr a LLanrwst. The band who gave their 
fans so many memories. I don't think so. </p>");
